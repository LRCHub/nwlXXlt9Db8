[00:18.29] Here we are, back again
[00:21.77] Fighting what's in front of me
[00:25.29] There's so much to unpack again
[00:28.82] But if I come to Italy
[00:39.82] 
[00:31.91] We could be nice to each other
[00:34.23] Nice to each other
[00:36.19] Wrong for each other
[00:37.86] Right for each other
[00:39.72] And rise to each other
[00:41.54] Rise to each other, mm-mm-mm
[00:55.54] 
[00:47.45] I don't know where the switches are
[00:50.90] Or where you keep the cutlery
[00:53.72] And I'll probably crash this stupid car
[00:57.75] And make your life a misery
[01:11.25] 
[01:00.90] But we could be nice to each other
[01:03.25] Nice to each other
[01:05.12] Wrong for each other
[01:06.77] Right for each other
[01:08.72] And rise to each other
[01:10.44] Rise to each other, mm-mm-mm
[01:24.44] 
[01:15.22] 'Cause you know, I've done all the classic stuff
[01:19.24] And it never works, you know it
[01:22.92] So can we say we'll never say the classic stuff?
[01:28.54] Just show it
[01:30.48] Now and know it
[01:34.30] Now
[01:36.19] Now, now, now
[01:42.69] 
[01:45.08] Meet me on the mountaintop
[01:48.75] I'll be in the shallow wind
[01:52.25] And wait for you to call it off
[01:55.80] 'Cause I don't want a boyfriend
[02:11.30] 
[01:58.75] But we could be nice to each other
[02:01.32] Nice to each other
[02:03.30] Wrong for each other
[02:05.06] Right for each other
[02:06.73] And rise to each other
[02:08.52] Rise to each other, mm-mm-mm
[02:22.52] 
[02:13.54] 'Cause you know, I've done all the classic stuff
[02:17.68] And it never works, you know it
[02:21.54] So can we say we'll never say the classic stuff?
[02:26.58] Just show it
[02:29.05] Water, sunlight, talking all night
[02:32.85] Just enough to grow it (yeah)
[02:36.60] Now and know it
[02:40.09] Now
[02:41.45] Now, now, now
[02:47.95] 
[02:47.45] Mm-mm
[02:50.21] It could be nice (it could be nice)
[02:53.93] It could be so nice (it could be so nice)
[02:57.66] Oh, it could be nice to (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:01.75] Oh, to each other (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:04.85] Mm-mm, we could be nice to (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:08.80] Oh, to each other (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:12.06] Mm-mm, we could be nice to (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:15.91] Oh, to each other (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:18.80] Mm-mm, we could be nice to (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
[03:22.67] Oh, to each other
